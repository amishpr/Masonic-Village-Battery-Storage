# Masonic Village Battery Storage Project

## Team Name

Turing-Compete

## Team Members

Stephen Pinto (sap5669@psu.edu)

Amish Prajapati (amish@psu.edu)

## Description Of Roles

Stephen Pinto - Develop control algorithms in a Texas Instrument chip to control Voltage/Current/Power of power electronics modules used in renewable energy sources

Amish Prajapati - Develop control algorithms in a Texas Instrument chip to control Voltage/Current/Power of power electronics modules used in renewable energy sources

## Project Advisor

Dr. Javad Khazaei, Ph.D. (khazaei@psu.edu)

## Project Description

Dr. Khazaei has a few projects to program power electronics converters used in Solar and Battery sources in power systems using Texas Instrument Controllers. Each project will have at least 2 EE student to develop the hardware components. The CSc students will help developing control algorithms in a Texas Instrument chip to control Voltage/Current/Power of power electronics modules used in renewable energy sources such as Solar/Wind or battery energy storage devices. Potential students will work with Code Composer Studio (Or any related programming language to code microcontrollers) to develop the control algorithms.
